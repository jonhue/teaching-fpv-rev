# Revision Course Functional Programming and Verification

The course is held in four sessions from June 24th to July 1st.

The sessions will include a comprehensive course overview.Some problems will be
solved together, for others you will get some time to start solving them on your
own. The material will include problems to work on between sessions. Questions
that might arise from those problems can be discussed in a subsequent session.

Make sure that you have a working installation of Haskell (GHC 8.4.4). If
possible, participate with a microphone to make the sessions as lively and
engaging as possible.
